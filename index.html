                <p class="about-paragraph"> Hello World! I'm Gilberto Rodriguez, a 23 year-old Software Engineer with a Computer Science degree from Texas A&M University-Commerce. Since I was a teen, I've always been intrigued with anything that has to deal with computers and creativity. When I built my first computer at 15 years old, I started to wonder how all of the computer parts and applications work with one another. This is how I was introduced to the world of computer science. I started programming in my first programming course during my second year of college and I immediately knew that I wanted to focus in becoming a software engineer. <br> As I continue my journey towards becoming a software engineer at a company, I'm excited about the opportunity to find an ideal company where I can utilize and refine my programming skills through creativity and teamwork.</p>

I collaborated with three other individuals and we used the Laravel framework and the SCRUM agile system to develop our website application. We met in-person every other week to discuss about any different algorithms or features that we wanted to implement.  This website application was intended for users to be able to create an account and create a tournament of different teams that allowed other users to join. I was in charge of the graphic design, the system sequence diagrams, and some of the front-end development for this project. </p>

This website allowed users to input, edit, or delete their information such as their sizes, interests, and favorite colors. All of the data was displayed in a table that contained every entry from every participant in each row. There was also an edit and delete button in each row so that the participants could change their interests/sizes if they wanted to. I built this website using SQL, PHP, CSS, and HTML. I also used inifinityfree to host the website and MySQL to manage my database.</p>
